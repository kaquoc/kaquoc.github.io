## Goal
The purpose of this project is to:
- Improve my understanding on UI design through HTML and CSS. 
    - How these can be improve with REACT (for later time).
- Learn and become familiar with JavaScript and its capability.
- Learn and create my own APIs.
- Understand how websites works and how developers/users interact with them through APIs.
- Have some fun!


### Mini Projects
The website also contains some smaller projects within it!
 1. FlightPointer Web edition
    A web application of FlightPointer application create using JavaScript. Calling ABDSX API to get information about flights in the 25 miles radius.
    Use flight coordinate and user's location to calculate the closest flight.
    Return its information and image through web scraping.
    UPDATE 07.17.2022: Unfortunately, FlightAware does not allow web-scrapping. (Check with https://flightaware.com/robots.txt) therefore we can't get picture.

    Intersting things I learn from this project:
        - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing/ Same-Origin policy.
            A cross domain security at client side which verify that server allowed to fetch data from your domain. Basically website server is verifying if your request comes from allowed domain list.
