# API and WEB SCRAPING
Document on the understanding of API and its usage.
Thank you FreeCodeCamp

## What is an API?
Application Programming Interface
Allow developer access to data. 
API exists everywhere!!!
Even in programming languages: e.g when you use built-in function such as String.toUpperCase();
The tools that take care of all the complicated stuff. 

## API vs Webscraping

You can web scrape to access data as well!
The difference is that web scraping access specific website(s) and specific data. Then using tools to convert those voluminous data in structured format for the users. Basically, if you want the data, you have to do all the work.

On the other hand, through the API, the user gain access directly to the data already in a structured format (such as JSON). Therefore the APIs depends on the owner of the dataset.
